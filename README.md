Simulation of the Truncated Standard Gaussian Distribution
==============================


This Shiny application is about the simulation of the [Truncated Standard Gaussian Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution) using an acceptance-rejection method. Two simulation algorithms are provided. The first one is a naive algorithm that consists of simulating a Standard Gaussian Variable and taking the values that exceed the truncation parameter while the second one is more efficient. The inputs of the application are the truncation parameter, the number of simulations and the type of algorithm. The output of the application is the histogram of realizations (empirical p.d.f) including the theoretical p.d.f.
